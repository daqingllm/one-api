# This setup assumes that you run the unit tests with code coverage in the same
# workflow that will also print the coverage report as comment to the pull request.
# Therefore, you need to trigger this workflow when a pull request is (re)opened or
# when new code is pushed to the branch of the pull request. In addition, you also
# need to trigger this workflow when new code is pushed to the main branch because
# we need to upload the code coverage results as artifact for the main branch as
# well since it will be the baseline code coverage.
#
# We do not want to trigger the workflow for pushes to *any* branch because this
# would trigger our jobs twice on pull requests (once from "push" event and once
# from "pull_request->synchronize")
